                <h1>WAYS TO CONSERVE ELECTRICITY</h1>
                <p style="font-size:22px; font-weight:400;"> 1.One of the best energy-saving devices is the light switch. Turn off lights when not required.
                    <br><br>
                    2. As for as possible use task lighting, which focuses light where it's needed. A reading lamp, for example,
                    lights only reading material rather than the whole room.
                    <br><br>
                    3.Keep doors to air-conditioned rooms closed as often as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    4.Dirty tube lights and bulbs reflect less light and can absorb 50 percent of the light; dust your tube lights
                    and lamps regularly.
                    <br><br>
                    5.A full refrigerator is a fine thing, but be sure to allow adequate air circulation inside.
                    <br><br>
                    6.Ninety percent of the energy consumed by an ordinary bulb (incandescent lamp) is given off as heat
                    rather than visible light.
                    <br><br>
                    7.If room air conditioner is older and needs repair, it's likely to be very inefficient. It may work out cheaper
                    on life cycle costing to buy a new energy-efficient air conditioner.
                    <br><br>
                    8.To help reduce heat loss, always insulate hot water pipes, especially where they run through unheated
                    areas. Never insulate plastic pipes.
                    <br><br>
                    9.If your computer must be left on, turn off the monitor; this device alone uses more than half the system's
                    energy.
                    <br><br>
                    10.Don't overfill the kettle for just one drink. Heat only the amount of water you need.
                    <br><br>
                    11.Using ceiling or room fans allows you to set the thermostat higher because the air movement will cool the
                    room.
                    <br><br>
                    12.Battery chargers, such as those for laptops, cell phones and digital cameras, draw power whenever they
                    are plugged in and are very inefficient. Pull the plug and save.
                    <br><br>
                    13.Think about what you need before opening refrigerator door. You'll reduce the amount of time the door
                    remains open.
                    <br><br>
                    14.When buying a new electric kettle, choose one that has an automatic shut-off button and a heat-resistant
                    handle.
                    <br><br> 
                    14.When buying a new electric kettle, choose one that has an automatic shut-off button and a heat-resistant
                    handle.
                    <br><br>
                    15. A good air conditioner will cool and dehumidify a room in about 30 minutes, so use a timer and leave the
                    unit off for some time.
                    <br><br>
                    16.Make sure that refrigerator's rubber door seals are clean and tight. They should hold a slip of paper
                    snugly. If paper slips out easily, replace the door seals.
                    <br><br>
                    17.Turn off your home office equipment when not in use. A computer that runs 24 hours a day, for instance,
                    uses - more power than an energy-efficient refrigerator.
                    <br><br>
                    18.Screen savers save computer screens, not energy. Start-ups and shutdowns do not use any extra energy,
                    nor are they hard on your computer components. In fact, shutting computers down when you are finished
                    using them actually reduces system wear - and saves energy.
                    <br><br>
                    19.Remember, microwaves cook food from the outside edge toward the centre of the dish, so if you're cooking more than one item, place larger and thicker items on the outside.
                    <br><br>
                    20.Allow hot and warm foods to cool and cover them well before putting them in refrigerator. Refrigerator will use less energy and condensation will reduced.
